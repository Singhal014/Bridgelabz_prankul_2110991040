rebase
git rebase is a command used to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving the base of the current branch to a new starting point. It rewrites the commit history, creating a linear sequence of commits, which makes the history cleaner and easier to understand.

Common Scenarios:
Rebasing onto another branch:

git rebase <branch>

2.
Create the Orphan Branch:

Copy code
git checkout --orphan <branchname>
Replace <branchname> with your desired branch name.
Remove the Existing Files (Optional):

When you create an orphan branch, the working directory keeps the files from your previous branch. If you want a clean slate:
git rm -rf .
Add New Files and Commit:

Add files for your new branch:
echo "New branch content" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for orphan branch"
Example:
bash
git checkout --orphan new-branch
git rm -rf .
echo "This is an orphan branch" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit for orphan branch"
