6.git merge branchname
= Go to the main branch (or any branch you want to merge into) and merge the specified branch (branchname) into it.
7. to push
git init                # Initialize Git (if needed)
git add <file-name>     # Stage the file
git commit -m "message" # Commit changes
git remote add origin <repository-URL> # Link to GitHub
or git add origin main  for already config with github
git push -u origin main # Push to GitHub

8. pull
git pull origin main

9. git clone
git clone <url>    is to use if you want to take particular branch clone in you local repo and if you want to take clone of the project

10. git diff <local-branch>..<remote>/<branch>
to check diff b/w local and remote

11. fetch vs pull
fetch = it is used to fetch remote project in local repo but it is not merge in local repo it is for to show you the if difference b/w the local repo and remote repo
if we want to take the remote repo then we have to merge the repo
git diff <local-branch>..<remote>/<branch> to check difference
git merge origin/main      This will merge the changes fetched from the remote branch (origin/main) into your local main branch.

pull = it is used to fetch and merge the repo
12. Summary of git diff Use Cases:
Unstaged Changes (working directory vs staging area):

bash
Copy code
git diff
Staged Changes (staging area vs last commit):

bash
Copy code
git diff --cached
Compare Two Branches:

bash
Copy code
git diff branch1..branch2
Compare Local Branch with Remote:

bash
Copy code
git diff branch..origin/branch

13. Purpose of git stash -u
By default, when you run git stash, it only stashes the tracked changes (i.e., files that are already being tracked by Git). However, if you have untracked files (files that are not added to the staging area or tracked by Git), they are not included in the stash.

When you use git stash -u (or git stash --include-untracked), it also stashes the untracked files, allowing you to temporarily save them along with the changes in your tracked files.
 Syntax

git stash show <stash@{n}>	Shows a summary of a specific stash
git stash show -p <stash@{n}>	Shows a detailed diff of a specific stash
git stash apply	                Applies the most recent stash without                 removing it from the stash list
git stash apply <stash@{n}>	Applies a specific stash without removing it from the stash list
git stash pop	                Applies and removes the most recent stash
git stash pop <stash@{n}>	Applies and removes a specific stash
git stash drop <stash@{n}>	Removes a specific stash without applying it
